    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gaufres are sweet waffles popular in France and Belgium, although their origin is believed to be as far back as
        ancient Greece.
    </p>
    <p>Gaufres are made with a batter of flour, milk, eggs, sugar and yeast that is baked in a special waffle maker that
        makes them
        crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside
    </p>
    <p>The waffle iron gives gaufres the typical 'honeycomb' appearance (which is called gaufre in French).
        With this type of griddle, you can also make waffles and chaffles.
    </p>
    <p>Gaufres are best eaten hot sprinkled with icing sugar or garnished with whipped cream, melted chocolate, syrups,
        jam or fresh berries.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>How to prepare Gaufre</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the dough for the gaufre, start by putting the 2 eggs in a large bowl </li>
        <li>stir with a wooden spoon then add the milk</li>
        <li>and melted butter</li>
        <li>Mix well and then, while stirring, add the sugar</li>
        <li>Then incorporate the flour, baking powder and salt by sifting them through a sieve</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients well</li>
        <li>add the seeds of the vanilla pod, cover the dough with cling film and let it rest for half an hour in the
            refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Heat the waffle maker to the highest temperature and brush it well with melted butter to prevent the dough
            from sticking.
            Place a ladleful of dough in the waffle iron and spread it well with the help of a spoon.</li>
        <li>(our waffle maker has a diameter of 16 cm). Now close the waffle maker and follow the machine's instructions
            regarding
            the cooking mode. Cook the gaufre for about 3-4 minutes, until it has taken on colour and is cooked on the
            inside.</li>
        <li>The gaufre should be slightly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Garnish the gaufre with a
            sprinkling of icing sugar.</li>
        <li>and serve them warm, accompanying them as you like (red fruits, chocolate, whipped cream, cocoa etc.).</li>
    </ol>
