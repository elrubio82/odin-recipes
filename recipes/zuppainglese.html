    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>zuppa inglese is one of the most popular spoon desserts in Italy.
        A typical dessert from the region of Emilia Romagna, it has now become
        one of the symbols of Italian confectionery, with several variations.
        Preparing zuppa inglese is not at all difficult; by making the two bases
        of which it is composed in good time, it will be very easy to assemble
        it and serve it as a dessert on a special day! How can one resist this
        spoon dessert composed, in our case, of layers of sponge cake soaked in
        alchermes, on top of which a chocolate custard alternating with vanilla
        cream is laid sweet and light. If you have all the necessary ingredients,
        we are ready to start cooking zuppa inglese!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For an 18cm sponge cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>To prepare the zuppa inglese, start by making the sponge cake.</p>
        <li>
            In a bowl, pour the eggs at room temperature and beat them with
            a whisk while adding the salt, vanilla seeds and sugar a little at a time
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead for about ten minutes or until the mixture becomes light and frothy:
            you can also test this by letting the mixture make a mark as if it were writing
        </li>
        <li>Then place a sieve in the bowl and pour the flour and potato starch into it</li>
        <li>Incorporate the powders by making gentle movements from the bottom upwards and
            ensuring that no residue remains at the bottom of the bowl
        </li>
        <li>Pour the dough into a previously buttered and floured 18 cm mould</li>
        <li>Level the surface and bake in a preheated oven in static mode at 160Â°
            for about 40 minutes, placing the drip pan on the lowest shelf (not in contact with the base);
            let cool and then unmould
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Vanilla cream and composition</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Meanwhile, take care of the custard. Pour milk and cream into a saucepan</li>
        <li>Extract the vanilla seeds, keeping them aside, from the pod and pour the
            latter into the saucepan. Heat, allowing it to come to the boil
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile pour the vanilla pulp over the yolks</li>
        <li>Add sugar, whisk quickly and then sieve in the cornstarch</li>
        <li>Stir and at this point milk and cream should be hot, so discard the pod</li>
        <li>And pour a couple of ladles into the egg mixture to dilute it</li>
        <li>Then pour into the pan</li>
        <li>And stir with a whisk while cooking for a few minutes. As soon as the cream thickens,
            you can turn off the flame</li>
        <li>Divide the cream into two bowls</li>
        <li>and into one pour the chocolate</li>
        <li>Take advantage of the fact that it
            is still very hot to help you melt it,
            then cover both creams with cling film and leave to cool</li>
        <li>Recover the ready and cooled sponge cake, use 70 g of it,
            cut it into vertical slices 1 cm thick</li>
        <li>then trimmed so that the pieces can fit into 4 x 150 ml beakers </li>
        <li>Soak, not too much, the sponge cake with alchermes </li>
        <li>and proceed by first pouring a little chocolate cream </li>
        <li>and then the classic one </li>
        <li>Give it a few taps under the glass so that everything is evenly
            distributed and then start again with the layers of soggy sponge cake </li>
        <li>and the two creams </li>
        <li>Level the surface with a spatula and repeat for all the other glasses.
            Finally, place them in the refrigerator to firm up for at least a couple of hours </li>
        <li>Sprinkle your glasses of trifle with bitter cocoa before serving and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
