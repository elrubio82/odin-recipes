# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website to practice all of the HTML knowledge acquired so far 
in the odin project foundation course. Main

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website wonâ€™t look very pretty as at this point through the course i have just 
gone through the HTML foundations.

This project is just to build my HTML chops; i will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
